/* ---- Theme switcher ----
 *
 * Flips `data-theme` on <html> and remembers the choice in localStorage. The initial
 * value is set by a small inline script in <head> rather than here, because this file
 * is deferred: waiting for it would paint the page in the wrong theme first and then
 * correct it, which is a visible flash on every load.
 *
 * Light is the default even when the OS prefers dark. These are paper pages usually
 * arrived at from a link and read once, and the light rendering is the one the figures
 * were authored against — so dark is opt-in rather than inferred.
 *
 * The favicon is a colour logo that reads on either tab background, so unlike
 * tuallen.github.io — whose favicon is a monochrome glyph that has to invert — there is
 * nothing to swap here.
